What is the GOOGLE_INPUT_CHEXT_FLAG in web pages?
---

Now a days I can see that just before the ending of the </body> tag something like below appears:

	<div id="GOOGLE_INPUT_CHEXT_FLAG" style="display: none;" input="" input_stat="{}"></div>

I can see this in every webpages whenever I try to Inspect Element in Google Chrome.

I have got the point. Its because of the extension: **Google Input Tools (by Google)**.
