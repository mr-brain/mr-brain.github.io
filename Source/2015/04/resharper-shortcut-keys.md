How to restore parameter info (argument list) shortcut with Resharper?

If you go to the **Visual Studio Tools -> Options -> Keyboard** section, you can type the shortcut in the shortcut keys edit box and VS will show what commands are bound to that shortcut combination. So, hitting **ctrl+shift+space** will show you that is mapped to **"Edit.ParameterInfo"** for the Workfow Designer, and **"ReSharper.ReSharper_CompleteCodeSmart"** for the Text Editor and the XAML UI Designer. You can do a similar thing with **ctrl+p**.
