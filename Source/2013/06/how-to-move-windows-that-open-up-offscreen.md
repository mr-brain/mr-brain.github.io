How to move windows that open up offscreen?
---

1.	Press *ALT* + *SPACE* to bring up the system menu (you won't see it because it is off screen) 
2.	Press *M* to select the "Move" menu choice.
3.	Press one of the arrow keys to initiate the movement.

Now just use the mouse to place the window where you want.

In fact, as long as we remember a few shortcuts, you can easily solve this small problem:

「Shift」＋「Win」＋ Left/Right Arrow: You can work around the screen to quickly switch windows.

 「Alt」＋ Space ＋「M」:  Can move the cursor quickly "stick" to the currently displayed warning window,  when you move the mouse,  you can drag the window to the front of the visible screen.
