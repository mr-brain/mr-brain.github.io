<h2>Database diagram support objects cannot be installed</h2>
<p>If you ever get a message like this when trying to create a diagram in SQL 2005/2008 Express.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Database diagram support objects cannot be installed because this database does not have a valid owner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To continue, first use the Files page of the Database Properties dialog box or the ALTER AUTHORIZATION statement to set the database owner to a valid login, then add the database diagram support objects.</p>
<p>Here's step by step what you have to do:</p>
<pre><code>EXEC sp_dbcmptlevel 'yourDB', '90';
go
ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON DATABASE::yourDB TO &quot;yourLogin&quot;
go
use [yourDB]
go
EXECUTE AS USER = N'dbo' REVERT
go
</code></pre>
