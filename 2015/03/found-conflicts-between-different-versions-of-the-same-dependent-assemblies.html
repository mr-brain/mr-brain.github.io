<p>Considering there are about 50 references across the projects I have in this solution, that isn't particularly helpful.</p>
<p>There is an easy way to get the compiler to spit out more information.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Visual Studio 2013 go to Tools &gt; Options.</li>
<li>Select Project and Solutions &gt; Build and Run.</li>
<li>Find the drop down MSBuild project build output verbosity. Here you can configure MSBuild to give you more information. By default it will be set to &quot;Minimal&quot;. Change this to &quot;Detailed'.</li>
<li>Rebuild and view the Output window. Copy everything into notepad and search for the <strong>warning</strong> which should tell you which assemblies you need to look at.</li>
</ol>
