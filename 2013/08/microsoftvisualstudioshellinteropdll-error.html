<h2>Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.dll ERROR</h2>
<p>VS 2008, COM interop, and Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop.dll</p>
<p>When I try to compile our VsPackages with VS 2008 the compilation fails. The compilation fails with the message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The assembly 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.Interop, Version=7.1.40304.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'
is not registered for COM Interop. Please register it with regasm.exe /tlb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a known bug that was discovered right as VS2008 was going out the door. Microsoft have a fix in place (to be delivered with VS 2008 SP1)</p>
